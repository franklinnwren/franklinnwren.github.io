                            <p class="tm-mb-40">Mar 1, 2023 posted by Franklin Ren</p>

                            <p>
                                Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) is perhaps the hottest topic for emerging tech start-ups in 2023. Starting from the release of image generation models (DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney) in earlier 2022, followed by a series of large language models (ChatGPT, BARD, LLaMA) at the end of 2022, AIGC has gathered a significant amount of public interest and demonstrated clear revenue models for start-up companies in this field. This passage summarizes some of the most promising AIGC companies that emerged in the past few years. Most of them are still very young, though some are already seeking IPO. It could be a good reference for people who are willing to join - and also a reference for potential founders to check who their possible competitors are.

                                <b>Stability AI</b>: An AI-driven visual art startup founded in 2019 by Emad Mostaque, Stability AI is best known for releasing so far the most popular open-source image generation model, Stable Diffusion. Although still a small size (less than 100 people), it already raised a fund of 89 million European dollars. It is also discussing a new round of funding of 1 billion investments which potentially lead to an IPO.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Stable Diffusion is a deep learning model for text-to-image generation. Its primary function is to create high-resolution detailed images based on textual input, but it can also be employed for various tasks like inpainting, outpainting, and producing image-to-image translations driven by textual prompts. It currently has 10 million average users per day. Stable Diffusion is open-sourced <a rel="nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion/" target="_blank">at HuggingFace</a>.

                                Currently, Stability AI charges users 0.2 dollars for each image they produce, though free trials are available. It also has a subscription-based API ranging from 9 to 149 dollars per month to train stable diffusion on custom datasets.
