                                Although a field currently under tremendous doubt and skepticism, the autonomous vehicle industry still attracts many top machine learning researchers and engineers. Not only because it is considered to be the AI application with the largest potential market size (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/global-road-haulage-market#:~:text=The%20global%20road%20haulage%20market%20size%20was%20estimated%20at%20USD,USD%203%2C091.7%20billion%20in%202020." target="_blank">several trillion</a>), but also because its challenging nature and unique way of allowing AI system to interact with the world. This blog gives a brief introduction to the autonomous vehicle industry and provides a list of the top players in the autonomous industry, including their founding history, current status, strengths, and weaknesses.

                                The autonomous vehicle industry focuses on the development and deployment of self-driving cars and other transportation systems that operate with minimal or no human intervention. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has defined six levels of driving automation. These levels provide a standardized way to describe the extent of a vehicle's autonomy and the role of the human driver. Level 0: the human drivers are fully in control of the vehicle at all times; Level 1: the vehicles have a single automated system that assists the driver in either steering or accelerating/braking (e.g., adaptive cruise control (ACC), lane-keeping, etc.) and the human drivers must be attentive at all times; Level 2: the vehicles can control both steering and acceleration/braking simultaneously under specific conditions, such as highway driving, but the human drivers are still responsible for monitoring the environment and must be ready to take control at any time. Level 3: the vehicles handle most driving tasks under certain conditions, the human drivers need to be present and ready to intervene, when necessary, but they are not required to pay constant attention to the driving environment. Level 4: the vehicles are capable to perform all driving tasks in specific driving scenarios without humans in the driver's seats. However, human drivers may still be required for driving outside of these predefined conditions. Level 5: Full self-driving cars in all conditions without driver's seats.

                                The current self-driving car technology stack could be broken out into four layers: perception, prediction, planning, and control. The perception layer involves the process of gathering data from various sensors, such as cameras, Lidar, Radar, and ultrasonic sensors, and fusing the information (often with deep learning algorithms like CNN variants) to create a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's surroundings. The prediction layer uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., RNN variants) and historical data to predict the likely trajectories and actions of other road users, helping in making informed decisions for the planning layer. The planning layer determines the optimal route and trajectory for the vehicle using the information from the perception layer and the prediction layer. Most current planning algorithms are search-based (e.g., RRT, D*), but learning-based planning such as RL is also under exploration. The control layer is responsible for executing the planned actions by controlling the vehicle's actuators, such as the throttle, brakes, and steering. Currently, traditional control algorithms like PID, LQR, and MPC are still predominantly used over learning algorithms due to their robustness and interpretability. It is also notable that there might be other layers such as localization and mapping, although sometimes considered to be part of the four layers above.

                                Recently, the progress of the self-driving car industry has been remarkable, as advancements in machine learning and sensor systems have accelerated the development of autonomous vehicles. A bunch of top players emerged in the past few years and have achieved significant progress. Those top players could be further divided into 5 categories: Subsidiaries of Big Tech, Subsidiaries of Automakers, Automakers Themselves, Automotive Technology Suppliers, and Independent Companies. Due to the different funding and operation nature of those 5 categories, the companies show more similarities within their categories but are usually significantly different from those in the other categories.

                                <b>Waymo (Subsidiary of Alphabet)</b>: Being one of the earliest players of autonomous vehicles, Waymo is considered to be owning the most cutting-edge tech stack in the autonomous driving industry. Waymo originates from a lab project Alphabet's innovation lab Google X run by co-founder Sergey Brin. Its original leader is Sebastian Thrun, a professor from Stanford University and two-time winner of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge" target="_blank">DARPA Grand Challenge</a>. He was partnered with two other DARPA stars, Chris Urmson from CMU and Anthony Levandowski from UCB during the early development of the tech stack. In December 2016, the project was renamed Waymo and became an independent for-profit subsidiary of Alphabet. After that, Waymo received a total fund of 5.5B while more than half of them are private equity funds from outside investors. At its peak in 2019, Waymo had a valuation of 200 billion, the highest ever for an AI company. Even now, it still has a valuation of 30 billion, comparable with the top-star company OpenAI.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Waymo focuses on L4 autonomous vehicles. Its main business model is in-city short-term ride-hailing (Robotaxi). It does not produce its own cars, instead establishing collaborations with several car manufacturers to incorporate its technology, such as Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Nissan-Renault, Stellantis, Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo, and Geely. In other words, Waymo operates more like “Uber without a driver”. In 2018, Waymo becomes the first company to receive a driverless test permit on the road from California DMV, a reflection of its technological advancement. It also has a very good record of safety, in 2020, it has only <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.statista.com/chart/17144/test-miles-and-reportable-miles-per-disengagement/" target="_blank">21 human interventions after running for 628839 miles</a>. Now, Waymo full driverless cars are already operating on a paid basis in Phoenix, Arizona. It is also expanding its business to other cities including San Francisco and Los Angeles where the driving condition is more complicated.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Waymo is a believer in Lidar, in its perception stack, Lidar plays a more significant role than cameras and other sensors. It is also developing its own Lidar and chips, which bring superior detection accuracy and latency within the industry, but also imposed a cost burden. Also, Waymo's dependence on HD maps might also affect the scalability of its business. However, it still has the most advanced and holistic technology stack within the industry and the best safety record among the companies with comparable testing distances. Hence, many believe Waymo is the most promising company to achieve full L4 self-driving.

                                <b>Zoox (Subsidiary of Amazon)</b>: Zoox was founded in 2014 by Tim Kentley-Klay and Jesse Levinson, the first one is an art designer and entrepreneur while the latter one is a former student of Sabastian Thurn at Stanford University. It raised a total funding of 1 billion and reached a peak valuation of 4.3 billion before selling to Amazon for 1.2 billion. Now it is part of the Amazon Devices & Services organization, along with other Amazon units like Amazon Alexa and the newly acquired company iRobot.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Similar to Waymo, Zoox also focuses on L4 ride-hailing business. However, apart from partnerships with existing car manufacturers, it also produced its own cars. A Zoox car follows a symmetrical, bi-directional design with no traditional front or rear end, steering wheel, or driver's seat. In July 2022, Zoox achieved a milestone by producing the first fully autonomous, all-electric passenger vehicle, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://zoox.com/journal/self-certification/" target="_blank">certified by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS)</a>. The Zoox cars integrate Lidar, Radar, and camera, to achieve robust perception. Although a leader in the robotic design and engineering for fully self-driving cars, Zoox is way behind Waymo and Cruise in its progress in road testing, which is a significant weakness. However, if Amazon keeps investing money in Zoox, it has a foreseeable long-term development scope.

                                <b>Baidu Apollo</b>: Launched in 2013, Baidu's Self-driving car project is the leading self-driving car company in China. After Qi Lu joined Baidu and came up with the “All in AI” strategy, it has become one of Baidu's most crucial future bets and received a significant amount of investment from Baidu. Baidu focuses on both L4 driverless taxis and driverless buses, partnering with BAIC Motor, GAC Group, Weltmeister, and King Long Bus. It is notable that Baidu's driverless bus (Apolong) also has its specific design for full self-driving like Zoox car, which could be a potential comparative advantage of Baidu. Additionally, it has an open-source L4 developer platform. In 2022, Baidu launched its paid self-driving taxi service in Beijing, without a driver in the seat.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Baidu's biggest challenge is its operating domain focus on China, where the driving condition is more complicated due to overwhelming pedestrians, motorcycles, and electric bicycles, making it hard to expand the operation domains. However, the good thing about a complicated testing environment is that it could obtain more out-of-domain data, which could be a valuable asset for a self-driving car company.

                                <b>Huawei Car BU</b>: Apart from Baidu, Huawei is another big tech in China that devoted a lot of resources to self-driving car development. Different from Baidu, Huawei's main focus is on L2 partnerships with existing car manufacturers, such as ARCFOX and Seres, although it also has some L4 tech stacks. Huawei shows no interest in the development of pure self-driving taxis, it defines itself as a service provider for car manufacturing companies, which makes Huawei bear fewer security-related burdens, and brings more flexibility.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The biggest challenge of Huawei's self-driving development is that it still struggles in getting partnerships with top car manufacturers, both ARCFOX and Seres have very limited customers, limiting the scope of the revenue of Huawei Car BU. Certain board members of Huawei like Chengdong Yu proposed to overcome this challenge by producing its own cars, but there are still huge objections from Huawei's founders as it could be a cash burden.

                                <b>Uber ATG (sold to Aurora)</b>: Launched in 2015, Uber ATG was a top player in the self-driving car industry. The founding members of uber ATG are from the National Robotics Engineering Center of CMU, led by Drew Bagnell, and some former Waymo employees, led by Anthony Levandowski, both group people had rich experiences in DARPA Grand Challenges. Uber ATG raised a total fund of 1 billion. The business model of Uber ATG was to provide services for Uber's own ride-hailing services. Leveraging Uber's rich driving data (perhaps the second largest, apart from Tesla), Uber aimed for L4 at the beginning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, Uber ATG was struggling with legal and safety problems. In 2017, Google sues Uber for <a rel="nofollow" href=" https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/waymo-v-uber-surprise-settlement-five-days-into-trialstealing" target="_blank">its technology</a> through hiring Anthony Levandowski. In 2018, a Uber testing car <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Elaine_Herzberg" target="_blank">killed a pedestrian</a> and raised tremendous concerns about self-driving car safety. Troubled by recurring legal problems, Uber announced that it will cut ATG and sell it to Aurora in 2020.

                                Subsidiaries of Big Tech are the main group of top players in self-driving cars. The cutting edges technologies of those big techs, especially in machine learning, give them a barrier of entry against other types of companies. Most of those companies focus on L4 Robotaxi, which is an asset-light strategy - a good fit for tech companies. The main burden of their business models is that they have to spend a significant amount of money and resources to collect enough driving data to handle the long-tail problem. Also, the safety requirement of L4 Robotaxi is also very steep, making it hard to commercialize. Nevertheless, the progress of those companies is most likely dependent on their parent companies' dedication to the market of self-driving. If their parent companies wish to support them, it is hard to imagine that there will be a funding problem, otherwise, like Uber ATG, they will face severe trouble.
