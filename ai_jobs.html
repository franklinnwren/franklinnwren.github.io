                            <p class="tm-mb-40">April 5, 2022 posted by Franklin Ren, largely revised on Oct 30, 2023</p>
                            <p>
                                Ever since the AlphaGo moment, there has been a tremendous amount of discussion about the possibility of AI replacing humans for most of our current jobs. This anxiety of people losing their jobs has escalated like never before after 2022 when image-generation tools like Stable Diffusion and text-generation tools like ChatGPT pushed the availability of AI to another level. There is already news about parents stopping their children from learning visual arts as they believe those jobs will be replaced by AI when their children grow up. I am also asked by a lot of friends not from the AI community about what kinds of jobs are safer in today's world. Here are some of my thoughts. This is not a theory or a formula - but rather a general guidance for evaluating the “safeness” of your jobs during the rapid growth of the AI industry.

                            <p>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Accessibility of training data</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most of our current AI models still require a large amount of domain expertise data to train. Hence, the accessibility of training data in your job domain could be an important factor that determines whether it is easy for people to train an AI model that possibly replace you. Almost all successful AI applications (AlphaGo, AlphaStar, AlphaFold, ChatGPT) come from domains where there is already a substantial amount of domain expertise data online to be readily used for AI training. AI in domains where training examples are harder to collect tends to evolve more slowly. For example, child daycare robots evolve much slower than chatbots which tell children stories. The imitation learning of the former might require millions of child daycare videos which you could find nowhere online. If learned from scratch without any imitation first, the robot could hurt the children or itself, which makes it less deployable. In contrast, chatbots could simply train from millions of fairy tales online before being deployed.
                            </p>

                                <b>Degree of customization</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The degree of customization of your job is another important factor. If the product or service of your job is highly customized, it is harder for an AI to quickly generalize to the degree you want. For example, when facing AI paintings like Stable Diffusion or Midjourney, manga drawers' roles are less threatened compared to poster drawers. One key reason is that many manga have specific storylines and the painting in the manga is highly customized, even a small detail will make the story completely different. Besides, most manga drawers' works have a strong personality which attracts a particular set of customers. In contrast, posters are usually vaguer and more generalized, where a slight change in detail usually doesn't change the entire topic. That will make it much easier for AI to generalize.
