                                Although a field currently under tremendous doubt and skepticism, the autonomous vehicle industry still attracts many top machine learning researchers and engineers. Not only because it is considered to be the AI application with the largest potential market size (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/global-road-haulage-market#:~:text=The%20global%20road%20haulage%20market%20size%20was%20estimated%20at%20USD,USD%203%2C091.7%20billion%20in%202020." target="_blank">several trillion</a>), but also because its challenging nature and unique way of allowing AI system to interact with the world. This blog gives a brief introduction to the autonomous vehicle industry and provides a list of the top players in the autonomous industry, including their founding history, current status, strengths, and weaknesses.

                                The autonomous vehicle industry focuses on the development and deployment of self-driving cars and other transportation systems that operate with minimal or no human intervention. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has defined six levels of driving automation. These levels provide a standardized way to describe the extent of a vehicle's autonomy and the role of the human driver. Level 0: the human drivers are fully in control of the vehicle at all times; Level 1: the vehicles have a single automated system that assists the driver in either steering or accelerating/braking (e.g., adaptive cruise control (ACC), lane-keeping, etc.) and the human drivers must be attentive at all times; Level 2: the vehicles can control both steering and acceleration/braking simultaneously under specific conditions, such as highway driving, but the human drivers are still responsible for monitoring the environment and must be ready to take control at any time. Level 3: the vehicles handle most driving tasks under certain conditions, the human drivers need to be present and ready to intervene, when necessary, but they are not required to pay constant attention to the driving environment. Level 4: the vehicles are capable to perform all driving tasks in specific driving scenarios without humans in the driver's seats. However, human drivers may still be required for driving outside of these predefined conditions. Level 5: Full self-driving cars in all conditions without driver's seats.

                                The current self-driving car technology stack could be broken out into four layers: perception, prediction, planning, and control. The perception layer involves the process of gathering data from various sensors, such as cameras, Lidar, Radar, and ultrasonic sensors, and fusing the information (often with deep learning algorithms like CNN variants) to create a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's surroundings. The prediction layer uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., RNN variants) and historical data to predict the likely trajectories and actions of other road users, helping in making informed decisions for the planning layer. The planning layer determines the optimal route and trajectory for the vehicle using the information from the perception layer and the prediction layer. Most current planning algorithms are search-based (e.g., RRT, D*), but learning-based planning such as RL is also under exploration. The control layer is responsible for executing the planned actions by controlling the vehicle's actuators, such as the throttle, brakes, and steering. Currently, traditional control algorithms like PID, LQR, and MPC are still predominantly used over learning algorithms due to their robustness and interpretability. It is also notable that there might be other layers such as localization and mapping, although sometimes considered to be part of the four layers above.

                                Recently, the progress of the self-driving car industry has been remarkable, as advancements in machine learning and sensor systems have accelerated the development of autonomous vehicles. A bunch of top players emerged in the past few years and have achieved significant progress. Those top players could be further divided into 5 categories: Subsidiaries of Big Tech, Subsidiaries of Automakers, Automakers Themselves, Automotive Technology Suppliers, and Independent Companies. Due to the different funding and operation nature of those 5 categories, the companies show more similarities within their categories but are usually significantly different from those in the other categories.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Category 1: Subsidiaries of Big Tech</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Those companies are often backed by big tech companies such as Apple, Google, and Amazon. They are either lab projects which are later separated from their parent companies for independent operation, or bought companies by their parent companies. A key trait of those companies is that their funding is almost purely dependent on their parent companies, although sometimes external funds are available to accelerate their R&D process. Most of them are able to operate independently, although sometimes they might face shareholder pressure from their parent companies due to the loss they are making.

                                <b>Waymo (Subsidiary of Alphabet)</b>: Being one of the earliest players of autonomous vehicles, Waymo is considered to be owning the most cutting-edge tech stack in the autonomous driving industry. Waymo originates from a project of Alphabet's innovation lab Google X run by co-founder Sergey Brin. Its original leader was Sebastian Thrun, a professor from Stanford University and two-time winner of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge" target="_blank">DARPA Grand Challenge</a>. He was partnered with two other DARPA stars, Chris Urmson from CMU and Anthony Levandowski from UCB during the early development of the tech stack. In December 2016, the project was renamed Waymo and became an independent for-profit subsidiary of Alphabet. After that, Waymo received a total fund of 5.5B where more than half of them are private equity funds from outside investors. At its peak in 2019, Waymo had a valuation of 200 billion, the highest ever for an AI company. Even now, it still has a valuation of 30 billion, comparable with the top-star company OpenAI.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Waymo focuses on L4 autonomous vehicles. Its main business model is in-city short-term ride-hailing (Robotaxi). It does not produce its own cars, instead establishing collaborations with several car manufacturers to incorporate its technology, such as Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Nissan-Renault, Stellantis, Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo, and Geely. In other words, Waymo operates more like “Uber without a driver”. In 2018, Waymo becomes the first company to receive a driverless test permit on the road from California DMV, a reflection of its technological advancement. It also has a very good record of safety, in 2020, it has only <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.statista.com/chart/17144/test-miles-and-reportable-miles-per-disengagement/" target="_blank">21 human interventions after running for 628839 miles</a>. Now, Waymo's fully driverless cars are already providing services on a paid basis in Phoenix, Arizona. It is also expanding its business to other cities including San Francisco and Los Angeles where the driving condition is more complicated.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Waymo is a believer in Lidar. In its perception stack, Lidar plays a more significant role than cameras and other sensors. It is also developing its own Lidars and chips, which bring superior detection accuracy and latency within the industry, however imposing a cost burden. Also, Waymo's dependence on HD maps might also affect the scalability of its business. Nevertheless, it still has the most advanced and holistic technology stack within the industry and the best safety record among the companies with comparable testing distances. Hence, many believe Waymo is the most promising company to achieve full L4 self-driving.

                                <b>Zoox (Subsidiary of Amazon)</b>: Zoox was founded in 2014 by Tim Kentley-Klay and Jesse Levinson, the first one is an art designer and entrepreneur while the latter one is a former student of Sabastian Thurn at Stanford University. It raised a total funding of 1 billion and reached a peak valuation of 4.3 billion before selling to Amazon for 1.2 billion. Now it is part of the Amazon Devices & Services organization, along with other Amazon units like Amazon Alexa and the newly acquired company iRobot.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Similar to Waymo, Zoox also focuses on L4 ride-hailing business. However, apart from partnerships with existing car manufacturers, it also produces its own cars. A Zoox car follows a symmetrical, bi-directional design with no traditional front or rear end, steering wheel, or driver's seat. In July 2022, Zoox achieved a milestone by producing the first fully autonomous, all-electric passenger vehicle, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://zoox.com/journal/self-certification/" target="_blank">certified by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS)</a>. The Zoox cars integrate Lidar, Radar, and cameras, to achieve robust perception. Although a leader in the robotic design and engineering for fully self-driving cars, Zoox is way behind Waymo and Cruise in its progress in road testing, which is a significant weakness. However, if Amazon keeps investing money in Zoox, it has a foreseeable long-term development scope.

                                <b>Baidu Apollo</b>: Launched in 2013, Baidu's Self-driving car project is the leading self-driving car company in China. After Qi Lu joined Baidu and came up with the “All in AI” strategy, it has become one of Baidu's most crucial future bets and received a significant amount of investment from Baidu. Baidu focuses on both L4 driverless taxis and driverless buses, partnering with BAIC Motor, GAC Group, Weltmeister, and King Long Bus. It is notable that Baidu's driverless bus (Apolong) also has a specific driverless design like the Zoox car, which could be a potential comparative advantage of Baidu. Additionally, it has an open-source L4 developer platform. In 2022, Baidu launched its paid self-driving taxi service in Beijing, without a driver in the seat.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Baidu's biggest challenge is its operating domain focus on China, where the driving condition is more complicated due to overwhelming pedestrians, motorcycles, and electric bicycles, making it challenging to expand the operation domains. However, the good thing about a complicated testing environment is that it could obtain more out-of-domain data, which could be a valuable asset for a self-driving car company.

                                <b>Huawei Car BU</b>: Apart from Baidu, Huawei is another big tech in China that devoted a lot of resources to self-driving car development. Different from Baidu, Huawei's main focus is on L2 partnerships with existing car manufacturers, such as ARCFOX and Seres, although it also has some L4 tech stacks. Huawei shows no interest in the development of pure self-driving taxis, it defines itself as a service provider for car manufacturing companies, which makes Huawei bear fewer security-related burdens, and brings more flexibility.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The biggest challenge of Huawei's self-driving development is that it still struggles in getting partnerships with top car manufacturers, both ARCFOX and Seres have very limited customers, limiting the scope of the revenue of Huawei Car BU. Certain board members of Huawei like Chengdong Yu proposed to overcome this challenge by producing its own cars, but there are still huge objections from Huawei's founders as it could be a cash burden.

                                <b>Uber ATG (sold to Aurora)</b>: Launched in 2015, Uber ATG was a top player in the self-driving car industry. The founding members of uber ATG are from the National Robotics Engineering Center of CMU, led by Drew Bagnell, and some former Waymo employees, led by Anthony Levandowski, both group people had rich experiences in DARPA Grand Challenges. Uber ATG raised a total fund of 1 billion. The business model of Uber ATG was to provide services for Uber's own ride-hailing services. Leveraging Uber's rich driving data (perhaps the second largest, apart from Tesla), Uber aimed for L4 at the beginning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, Uber ATG was struggling with legal and safety problems. In 2017, Google sues Uber for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/waymo-v-uber-surprise-settlement-five-days-into-trial" target="_blank">stealing its technology</a> through hiring Anthony Levandowski. In 2018, a Uber testing car <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Elaine_Herzberg" target="_blank">killed a pedestrian</a> and raised tremendous concerns about self-driving car safety. Troubled by recurring legal problems, Uber announced that it will cut ATG and sell it to Aurora in 2020.

                                <b>Apple</b>: There is no doubt that apple also has its self-driving car project. However, since apple is relatively conservative in disclosing its information, we have very limited knowledge about what Apple's self-driving car project is like. It is suspected that it will produce its own electric car, like Tesla, with self-driving components on it. Sources review that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://jalopnik.com/apple-s-mystery-self-driving-car-tech-covered-13-000-mi-1848522875#:~:text=And%2C%20according%20to%20the%20latest,over%20the%20course%20of%202021." target="_blank">its testing fleet of self-driving cars covered more than 13,000 miles over the course of 2021</a>.

                                Subsidiaries of Big Tech are the main group of top players in self-driving cars. The cutting edges technologies of those big techs, especially in machine learning, give them a barrier of entry against other types of companies. Most of those companies focus on L4 Robotaxi, which is an asset-light strategy - a good fit for tech companies. The main burden of their business models is that they have to spend a significant amount of money and resources to collect enough driving data to handle the long-tail problem. Also, the safety requirement of L4 Robotaxi is also very steep, making it hard to commercialize. Nevertheless, the progress of those companies is most likely dependent on their parent companies' dedication to the market of self-driving. If their parent companies wish to support them, it is hard to imagine that there will be a funding problem, otherwise, like Uber ATG, they will face severe trouble.

                            <p>
                                Companies within this group are either initial investments of car companies or acquired by them. Compared with companies within the previous group, those companies usually have strong ties to the car companies, or what we call OEMs in the self-driving industry. That means those companies' self-driving technology stack might be obliged to integrate with the brand of cars of their parent companies. A good thing about them is that they might not need a tremendous amount of money to build their testing fleet (those fleets could be subsidized by their parent companies) - a major cost burden being removed. They might need, on the other hand, to share some of their tech stacks (usually L2) with their parent companies for profit.

                                <b>Cruise (Subsidiaries of General Motors)</b>: Founded in 2013 by another DARPA star from MIT, Kyle Vogt, and an experienced entrepreneur, Dan Kan, Cruise is considered to be the second-most promising self-driving car company, behind Waymo. Its earlier investor includes Y Combinator. In March 2016, it was acquired by General Motors with estimates ranging from over 500 million to 1 billion and quickly become the foundation of GM's endeavors in autonomous driving for the next-generation cars. Cruise has perhaps one of the best balance sheets among all self-driving companies, with a 15.1 billion total funding amount and about 10 billion in current cash reserves. That allows Cruise to build a large testing fleet for its autonomy tech stack and also provides one of the highest average packages for its software engineers in the bay area. Cruise has a valuation of 30 billion.

Although its HD map progress is a bit behind Waymo, it is planning to expand its focus on HD maps to improve efficiency and safety. Its radical service expansion could bring more out-of-domain data, which is crucial for self-driving cars, but also generate a bunch of safety concerns. Many critics are surrounding Cruise for bringing a yet-to-be-ready technology to the road and increasing public safety concerns. However, if the safety concerns are well addressed, Cruise could still be one of the most promising companies to be the first to achieve L5 self-driving.

                                After incurring a significant loss, Ford and Volkswagen decided to shut down Argo AI in October 2022 and integrate its employees into their own businesses. Fort plans to transfer Argo's tech stack into its L2/L3 projects, which are considered to be more profitable, while Volkswagen continues developing L4 for its own cars, but withdraws from the Robotaxi business. The difference between the fate of Cruise and Argo AI suggests that the business of Subsidiaries of Automakers is highly dependent on the high-level decisions making of their parent companies. While GM is generous in investing in L4, Ford clearly thinks L2/L3 is a more viable business model.

                                Unlike subsidiaries of major tech companies, automaker subsidiaries typically have an easier time constructing their testing fleets, providing a competitive edge in data collection. However, car manufacturers often face greater profit pressures compared to big tech firms, which can achieve asymmetric profits, and tend to exhibit less patience for long-term technology development. As a result, many car companies show increased interest in Level 2 autonomous systems, a profitable approach demonstrated by Tesla. It is likely that the future will see a blend of Level 4/5 and Level 2/3 development pursued by automaker subsidiaries.

A good example is Tesla Motors, where the Autopilot team (later FSD team) is an essential part of the company.

                                <b>Tesla</b>:  In October 2014, Tesla released Autopilot on its ground-breaking electrical car, Model S, and quickly gathered the attention of many users. Its initial leader was Sterling Anderson, designer of Model X. Two years later, Elon Musk changed its name to Full-Self-Driving (FSD) we all know today, and sell it as software to Tesla users. After Sterling left his position, Elon Musk subsequently hired Jim Keller for hardware development and Chris Lattner for software development. He also hired Andrej Karpathy, a computer vision scientist and a student of Professor Fei-Fei Li, to develop novel computer vision algorithms for Tesla FSD. Today, Tesla FSD is running on 400000 electrical cars in North America only, more than the sum of all other self-driving companies.

                                Different from Google, Tesla is not a believer in Lidar. Although the first version of Autopilot has a single Lidar, it was later removed in favor of a pure vision-based algorithm which Elon Musk favors. Tesla's confidence in pure vision-based algorithms is based on the tremendous amount of testing data its users are gathering every day. Since deep learning is somehow data-driven, Musk believes it will be able to handle all possible out-of-domain cases required for self-driving as long as they have enough data - an idea which many computer vision scientists disagree with.

                                Tesla FSD is still in the L2 stage. When it is trying to move from L2 to L3/L4 stages, its pure vision-based algorithm is bringing significant safety concerns. Since 2016, the federal agency has investigated 35 crashes in which Tesla's Autopilot or FSD systems were likely in use. Together, these accidents have <a rel="nofollow" href=" https://theintercept.com/2023/01/10/tesla-crash-footage-autopilot/" target="_blank">killed 19 people</a>. Many have urged California DMV to limit the use of Tesla FSD and prevent Tesla from marketing its Self-Driving technologies. However, market-wise, FSD has no doubt achieved great commercial success. The price of FSD rose to 15000 dollars per car in 2021, and Tesla's self-driving unit might have become the first which turned into profit. However, whether a data-driven pure vision-based algorithm is able to achieve full self-driving stays a debatable matter.
